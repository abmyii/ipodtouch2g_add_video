Only 360p is supported (for IPod Touch 2G)

TODO:
Test multiple videos

Ideas:
Interactive "console" (Future)
Option to clear modifications (delete all which have "Videos/" in filename) (Future)

Known bugs:
Searching causes Videos app to crash and reset database to backup
Thumbnail doesn't change
IFuse doesn't work on udocker so manually mount IPod in /tmp/IPod
