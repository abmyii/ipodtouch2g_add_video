Ideas:
Video timelength
Mount automatically
Option to clear modifications (delete all which have "Videos/" in filename)
Automatically make Videos folder
Faster way to copy

Only 360p is supported (for IPod Touch 2G)

Known bugs:
Searching causes Videos app to crash and reset database to backup.
Thumbnail doesn't change.
